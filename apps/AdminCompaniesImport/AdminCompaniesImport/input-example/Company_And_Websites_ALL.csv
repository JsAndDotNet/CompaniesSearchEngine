In the Clinical Trials, Polarean’s 129Xenon gas MRI was used to measure regional pulmonary function in patients with a wide variety of underlying lung diseases who were being evaluated for possible lung resection or lung transplant surgery. As detailed in the Company’s announcement of 29 January 2020, both Clinical Trials met their primary endpoints, showing pre-defined equivalence of hyperpolarised 129Xenon Gas MRI to an approved comparator, 133 Xenon Scintigraphy, and displayed a benign safety profile.
129Xenon, when polarised in Polarean’s proprietary drug-device system, permits functional, regional and quantitative imaging of the lungs using MRI, without the risk of exposing patients to ionising radiation. The polarised 129Xenon is administered as an inhaled gas that is given to patients in a 10 second breath-hold MRI procedure.
